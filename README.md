## Course 1: Introduction to Git (Beginner) ‚úÖ

### Chapter 01: Getting Started with Git

#### Essential Terminal Commands
```bash
pwd                    # Print working directory
ls                     # List directory contents
cd directory-name      # Change directory
```

#### Git Setup and Basic Operations
```bash
git --version                        # Check Git version
git init directory-name              # Create new repo with directory
git init                            # Convert existing project to repo
git status                          # Check what files are being tracked
```

#### Staging and Committing
```bash
git add README.md                   # Add specific file to staging area
git add .                          # Add all modified files to staging area
git commit -m "Adding a README."   # Make commit with message (-m flag avoids opening text editor)
```

### Chapter 02: Understanding Git Structure and History

#### Git Internal Structure
- **Commit**: Snapshot of your project at a specific point in time
- **Tree**: Directory structure and file organization
- **Blob**: Binary Large Object (stores file content)
- **Git Hash**: Pseudo-random number generated by hash function for unique identification

#### Viewing Commit History
```bash
git log                                    # View full commit history
git log -3                                # Show last 3 commits
git log report.md                         # Show commits for specific file
git log -2 mental_health_survey.csv      # Combine techniques: last 2 commits for specific file
```

**Navigation in git log:**
- Press `Space` to show more recent commits
- Press `q` to quit log and return to terminal

#### Filtering by Date Range
```bash
git log --since='Apr 2 2024'                           # Commits since specific date
git log --since='Apr 2 2024' --until='Apr 11 2024'    # Commits between dates
```

**Acceptable Date Formats:**
- Natural language: "2 weeks ago", "3 months ago", "yesterday"
- ISO Format (recommended): "2024-07-15" (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Alternative formats: "15 Jul 2024", "15 July 2024"
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Invalid: "15 Jul, 2024"
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Ambiguous: "12-06-2024" (could be Dec 6 or June 12)

#### Examining Specific Commits
```bash
git show c27fa856    # Show specific commit (first 8-10 characters of hash sufficient)
```

#### Comparing Versions
```bash
# Basic comparisons
git diff                    # Compare working directory with last commit
git diff report.md         # Compare specific file

# Staged file comparisons
git add report.md
git diff --staged report.md    # Compare staged file with last commit
git diff --staged             # Compare all staged files

# Commit comparisons
git diff 35f4b4d 186398f     # Compare two specific commits
git diff HEAD~1 HEAD         # Compare second most recent with most recent
git diff HEAD~1 HEAD~2       # Compare using HEAD notation
```

#### Restoring and Reverting

**Reverting Commits:**
```bash
git revert HEAD                # Revert most recent commit
git revert --no-edit HEAD     # Revert without opening text editor
git revert -n HEAD            # Revert without committing (stage changes only)
```

**Text Editor Commands (for commit messages):**
- Save: `Ctrl + O`, then `Enter`
- Exit: `Ctrl + X`

**Reverting Single Files:**
```bash
git checkout HEAD~1 -- report.md    # Revert specific file to previous commit
git status                          # Check status after checkout
```

**Unstaging Files:**
```bash
git restore --staged summary_statistics.csv    # Unstage specific file
git restore --staged                           # Unstage all files
```
