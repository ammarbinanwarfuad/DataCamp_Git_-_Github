## Course 1: Introduction to Git (Beginner) ‚úÖ

### Chapter 01: Getting Started with Git

#### Essential Terminal Commands
```bash
pwd                    # Print working directory
ls                     # List directory contents
cd directory-name      # Change directory
```

#### Git Setup and Basic Operations
```bash
git --version                        # Check Git version
git init directory-name              # Create new repo with directory
git init                            # Convert existing project to repo
git status                          # Check what files are being tracked
```

#### Staging and Committing
```bash
git add README.md                   # Add specific file to staging area
git add .                          # Add all modified files to staging area
git commit -m "Adding a README."   # Make commit with message (-m flag avoids opening text editor)
```

### Chapter 02: Understanding Git Structure and History

#### Git Internal Structure
- **Commit**: Snapshot of your project at a specific point in time
- **Tree**: Directory structure and file organization
- **Blob**: Binary Large Object (stores file content)
- **Git Hash**: Pseudo-random number generated by hash function for unique identification

#### Viewing Commit History
```bash
git log                                    # View full commit history
git log -3                                # Show last 3 commits
git log report.md                         # Show commits for specific file
git log -2 mental_health_survey.csv      # Combine techniques: last 2 commits for specific file
```

**Navigation in git log:**
- Press `Space` to show more recent commits
- Press `q` to quit log and return to terminal

#### Filtering by Date Range
```bash
git log --since='Apr 2 2024'                           # Commits since specific date
git log --since='Apr 2 2024' --until='Apr 11 2024'    # Commits between dates
```

**Acceptable Date Formats:**
- Natural language: "2 weeks ago", "3 months ago", "yesterday"
- ISO Format (recommended): "2024-07-15" (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Alternative formats: "15 Jul 2024", "15 July 2024"
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Invalid: "15 Jul, 2024"
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Ambiguous: "12-06-2024" (could be Dec 6 or June 12)

#### Examining Specific Commits
```bash
git show c27fa856    # Show specific commit (first 8-10 characters of hash sufficient)
```

#### Comparing Versions
```bash
# Basic comparisons
git diff                    # Compare working directory with last commit
git diff report.md         # Compare specific file

# Staged file comparisons
git add report.md
git diff --staged report.md    # Compare staged file with last commit
git diff --staged             # Compare all staged files

# Commit comparisons
git diff 35f4b4d 186398f     # Compare two specific commits
git diff HEAD~1 HEAD         # Compare second most recent with most recent
git diff HEAD~1 HEAD~2       # Compare using HEAD notation
```

#### Restoring and Reverting

**Reverting Commits:**
```bash
git revert HEAD                # Revert most recent commit
git revert --no-edit HEAD     # Revert without opening text editor
git revert -n HEAD            # Revert without committing (stage changes only)
```

**Text Editor Commands (for commit messages):**
- Save: `Ctrl + O`, then `Enter`
- Exit: `Ctrl + X`

**Reverting Single Files:**
```bash
git checkout HEAD~1 -- report.md    # Revert specific file to previous commit
git status                          # Check status after checkout
```

**Unstaging Files:**
```bash
git restore --staged summary_statistics.csv    # Unstage specific file
git restore --staged                           # Unstage all files
```

## Course 2: Intermediate Git (Beginner) ‚úÖ

### Chapter 01: Introduction to Branches

#### Understanding Branches
- **Branch**: An individual version of a repository
- Git uses branches to systematically track multiple versions of files
- In each branch:
  - Some files might be the same
  - Others might be different  
  - Some may not exist at all

#### Why Use Branches?
- **Live System Protection**: Default branch (`main`) works as expected
- **Feature Development**: Develop new features without affecting live system
- **Parallel Development**: Multiple developers can work simultaneously
- **Comparison**: Compare repo state between branches
- **Integration**: Combine contents and push new features to live system
- **Purpose-Driven**: Each branch should have a specific purpose

#### Working with Branches
```bash
# List all branches
git branch                    # Shows all branches (* indicates current branch)

# Switch between branches
git switch main              # Switch to main branch

# Create new branch
git branch speed-test        # Create new branch
git switch speed-test        # Switch to new branch
git switch -c speed-test     # Create and switch in one command
```

#### Branch Terminology
- **Branching off**: Creating a new branch
- **Branching off main**: Creating a new branch from main branch

### Chapter 02: Working with Branches (Modifying, Comparing, Merging, Conflicts, Remotes)

#### Diff Recap
```bash
git diff                            # Changes between unstaged files and latest commit
git diff report.md                  # Changes between unstaged file and latest commit
git diff --staged                   # Changes between staged files and latest commit
git diff --staged report.md         # Changes between staged file and latest commit
git diff 35f4b4d 186398f            # Changes between two commits using hashes
git diff HEAD~1 HEAD~2              # Changes between commits using HEAD notation
```

#### Comparing Branches
```bash
git diff main summary-statistics     # Compare main branch with summary-statistics branch
```

**Navigation**: Press `Space` to progress through large outputs, `q` to exit

#### Branch Management
```bash
# Rename branch
git branch -m feature_dev chatbot   # Rename feature_dev to chatbot

# Delete merged branch
git branch -d chatbot               # Delete branch that has been merged
# Output: Deleted branch chatbot (was 3edb989).

# Delete unmerged branch (force delete)
git branch -D chatbot               # Force delete unmerged branch
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: Difficult to recover deleted branches - be sure before deleting!

#### Merging Branches
- **Purpose**: Each branch should have a specific purpose (new feature, debugging)
- **Integration**: Incorporate changes into production (main branch = "ground truth")
- **Terminology**:
  - **Parent commits**: Last commits from each branch being merged
  - **Source**: Branch we want to merge from
  - **Destination**: Branch we want to merge into

```bash
# Basic merge workflow
git switch main                     # Move to destination branch
git merge ai-assistant             # Merge source branch into current branch

# Alternative syntax
git merge ai-assistant main        # Merge from any branch
```

**Merge Types**:
- **Fast-forward**: Linear commit history, points main to last commit in source branch
- **Three-way merge**: When branches have diverged

#### Merge Conflicts
- **Conflict**: Inability to resolve differences in file contents between branches
- **Cause**: Same file edited in two branches, Git doesn't know which version to keep

**Conflict Resolution Process**:
```bash
# When conflict occurs
git merge documentation
# Output: Auto-merging README.md
#         CONFLICT (add/add): Merge conflict in README.md
#         Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.

# Open conflicted file
nano README.md
```

**Git Conflict Syntax**:
```
<<<<<<< HEAD
Content from current branch
=======
Content from branch being merged
>>>>>>> branch-name
```

**Resolution Steps**:
1. Edit file to resolve conflicts
2. Remove conflict markers
3. Save (`Ctrl + O`, then `Enter`) and exit (`Ctrl + X`)
4. Complete merge:
```bash
git add README.md
git commit -m "Resolving README.md conflict"
git merge documentation              # Should show "Already up to date."
```

#### Working with Remotes
- **Local repo**: Repository on your local computer
- **Remote repo**: Repository stored elsewhere (usually online)

**Benefits of Remote Repos**:
- Everything is backed up
- Collaboration regardless of location

**Cloning Repositories**:
```bash
# Clone local project
git clone /home/george/repo
git clone /home/george/repo new_repo    # Clone and rename

# Clone remote repository
git clone https://github.com/datacamp/project
```

**Remote Operations**:
```bash
# List remotes
git remote                          # Shows remote names
git remote -v                       # Shows remote URLs

# Add new remote
git remote add george https://github.com/george_datacamp/repo
```

**Note**: When cloning, Git automatically names the remote `origin`

#### Pulling from Remotes
- **Fetch**: Download remote content without merging
- **Pull**: Fetch and merge in one command

```bash
# Fetch operations
git fetch origin                    # Fetch all remote branches
git fetch origin main              # Fetch only main branch

# Merge remote content
git merge origin                    # Merge origin's main into current branch

# Pull (fetch + merge)
git pull origin                     # Pull from origin's default branch
git pull origin dev                 # Pull from origin's dev branch
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: Always commit local changes before pulling!

#### Pushing to Remotes
```bash
# Basic push
git push origin main               # Push main branch to origin remote

# Push new local branch to remote
git push origin hotfix             # Creates hotfix branch on remote
```

**Push/Pull Best Practices**:
1. Save changes locally first
2. Pull before pushing to avoid conflicts
3. Handle conflicts locally before pushing

**Avoiding Conflicts**:
```bash
git pull origin main               # Pull latest changes first
git push origin main               # Then push your changes

# Pull without opening editor (use with caution)
git pull --no-edit origin main
```
