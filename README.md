## Course 1: Introduction to Git (Beginner) ‚úÖ

### Chapter 01: Getting Started with Git

#### Essential Terminal Commands
```bash
pwd                    # Print working directory
ls                     # List directory contents
cd directory-name      # Change directory
```

#### Git Setup and Basic Operations
```bash
git --version                        # Check Git version
git init directory-name              # Create new repo with directory
git init                            # Convert existing project to repo
git status                          # Check what files are being tracked
```

#### Staging and Committing
```bash
git add README.md                   # Add specific file to staging area
git add .                          # Add all modified files to staging area
git commit -m "Adding a README."   # Make commit with message (-m flag avoids opening text editor)
```

### Chapter 02: Understanding Git Structure and History

#### Git Internal Structure
- **Commit**: Snapshot of your project at a specific point in time
- **Tree**: Directory structure and file organization
- **Blob**: Binary Large Object (stores file content)
- **Git Hash**: Pseudo-random number generated by hash function for unique identification

#### Viewing Commit History
```bash
git log                                    # View full commit history
git log -3                                # Show last 3 commits
git log report.md                         # Show commits for specific file
git log -2 mental_health_survey.csv      # Combine techniques: last 2 commits for specific file
```

**Navigation in git log:**
- Press `Space` to show more recent commits
- Press `q` to quit log and return to terminal

#### Filtering by Date Range
```bash
git log --since='Apr 2 2024'                           # Commits since specific date
git log --since='Apr 2 2024' --until='Apr 11 2024'    # Commits between dates
```

**Acceptable Date Formats:**
- Natural language: "2 weeks ago", "3 months ago", "yesterday"
- ISO Format (recommended): "2024-07-15" (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Alternative formats: "15 Jul 2024", "15 July 2024"
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Invalid: "15 Jul, 2024"
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Ambiguous: "12-06-2024" (could be Dec 6 or June 12)

#### Examining Specific Commits
```bash
git show c27fa856    # Show specific commit (first 8-10 characters of hash sufficient)
```

#### Comparing Versions
```bash
# Basic comparisons
git diff                    # Compare working directory with last commit
git diff report.md         # Compare specific file

# Staged file comparisons
git add report.md
git diff --staged report.md    # Compare staged file with last commit
git diff --staged             # Compare all staged files

# Commit comparisons
git diff 35f4b4d 186398f     # Compare two specific commits
git diff HEAD~1 HEAD         # Compare second most recent with most recent
git diff HEAD~1 HEAD~2       # Compare using HEAD notation
```

#### Restoring and Reverting

**Reverting Commits:**
```bash
git revert HEAD                # Revert most recent commit
git revert --no-edit HEAD     # Revert without opening text editor
git revert -n HEAD            # Revert without committing (stage changes only)
```

**Text Editor Commands (for commit messages):**
- Save: `Ctrl + O`, then `Enter`
- Exit: `Ctrl + X`

**Reverting Single Files:**
```bash
git checkout HEAD~1 -- report.md    # Revert specific file to previous commit
git status                          # Check status after checkout
```

**Unstaging Files:**
```bash
git restore --staged summary_statistics.csv    # Unstage specific file
git restore --staged                           # Unstage all files
```

## Course 2: Intermediate Git (Beginner) ‚úÖ

### Chapter 01: Introduction to Branches

#### Understanding Branches
- **Branch**: An individual version of a repository
- Git uses branches to systematically track multiple versions of files
- In each branch:
  - Some files might be the same
  - Others might be different  
  - Some may not exist at all

#### Why Use Branches?
- **Live System Protection**: Default branch (`main`) works as expected
- **Feature Development**: Develop new features without affecting live system
- **Parallel Development**: Multiple developers can work simultaneously
- **Comparison**: Compare repo state between branches
- **Integration**: Combine contents and push new features to live system
- **Purpose-Driven**: Each branch should have a specific purpose

#### Working with Branches
```bash
# List all branches
git branch                    # Shows all branches (* indicates current branch)

# Switch between branches
git switch main              # Switch to main branch

# Create new branch
git branch speed-test        # Create new branch
git switch speed-test        # Switch to new branch
git switch -c speed-test     # Create and switch in one command
```

#### Branch Terminology
- **Branching off**: Creating a new branch
- **Branching off main**: Creating a new branch from main branch

### Chapter 02: Working with Branches (Modifying, Comparing, Merging, Conflicts, Remotes)

#### Diff Recap
```bash
git diff                            # Changes between unstaged files and latest commit
git diff report.md                  # Changes between unstaged file and latest commit
git diff --staged                   # Changes between staged files and latest commit
git diff --staged report.md         # Changes between staged file and latest commit
git diff 35f4b4d 186398f            # Changes between two commits using hashes
git diff HEAD~1 HEAD~2              # Changes between commits using HEAD notation
```

#### Comparing Branches
```bash
git diff main summary-statistics     # Compare main branch with summary-statistics branch
```

**Navigation**: Press `Space` to progress through large outputs, `q` to exit

#### Branch Management
```bash
# Rename branch
git branch -m feature_dev chatbot   # Rename feature_dev to chatbot

# Delete merged branch
git branch -d chatbot               # Delete branch that has been merged
# Output: Deleted branch chatbot (was 3edb989).

# Delete unmerged branch (force delete)
git branch -D chatbot               # Force delete unmerged branch
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: Difficult to recover deleted branches - be sure before deleting!

#### Merging Branches
- **Purpose**: Each branch should have a specific purpose (new feature, debugging)
- **Integration**: Incorporate changes into production (main branch = "ground truth")
- **Terminology**:
  - **Parent commits**: Last commits from each branch being merged
  - **Source**: Branch we want to merge from
  - **Destination**: Branch we want to merge into

```bash
# Basic merge workflow
git switch main                     # Move to destination branch
git merge ai-assistant             # Merge source branch into current branch

# Alternative syntax
git merge ai-assistant main        # Merge from any branch
```

**Merge Types**:
- **Fast-forward**: Linear commit history, points main to last commit in source branch
- **Three-way merge**: When branches have diverged

#### Merge Conflicts
- **Conflict**: Inability to resolve differences in file contents between branches
- **Cause**: Same file edited in two branches, Git doesn't know which version to keep

**Conflict Resolution Process**:
```bash
# When conflict occurs
git merge documentation
# Output: Auto-merging README.md
#         CONFLICT (add/add): Merge conflict in README.md
#         Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.

# Open conflicted file
nano README.md
```

**Git Conflict Syntax**:
```
<<<<<<< HEAD
Content from current branch
=======
Content from branch being merged
>>>>>>> branch-name
```

**Resolution Steps**:
1. Edit file to resolve conflicts
2. Remove conflict markers
3. Save (`Ctrl + O`, then `Enter`) and exit (`Ctrl + X`)
4. Complete merge:
```bash
git add README.md
git commit -m "Resolving README.md conflict"
git merge documentation              # Should show "Already up to date."
```

#### Working with Remotes
- **Local repo**: Repository on your local computer
- **Remote repo**: Repository stored elsewhere (usually online)

**Benefits of Remote Repos**:
- Everything is backed up
- Collaboration regardless of location

**Cloning Repositories**:
```bash
# Clone local project
git clone /home/george/repo
git clone /home/george/repo new_repo    # Clone and rename

# Clone remote repository
git clone https://github.com/datacamp/project
```

**Remote Operations**:
```bash
# List remotes
git remote                          # Shows remote names
git remote -v                       # Shows remote URLs

# Add new remote
git remote add george https://github.com/george_datacamp/repo
```

**Note**: When cloning, Git automatically names the remote `origin`

#### Pulling from Remotes
- **Fetch**: Download remote content without merging
- **Pull**: Fetch and merge in one command

```bash
# Fetch operations
git fetch origin                    # Fetch all remote branches
git fetch origin main              # Fetch only main branch

# Merge remote content
git merge origin                    # Merge origin's main into current branch

# Pull (fetch + merge)
git pull origin                     # Pull from origin's default branch
git pull origin dev                 # Pull from origin's dev branch
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: Always commit local changes before pulling!

#### Pushing to Remotes
```bash
# Basic push
git push origin main               # Push main branch to origin remote

# Push new local branch to remote
git push origin hotfix             # Creates hotfix branch on remote
```

**Push/Pull Best Practices**:
1. Save changes locally first
2. Pull before pushing to avoid conflicts
3. Handle conflicts locally before pushing

**Avoiding Conflicts**:
```bash
git pull origin main               # Pull latest changes first
git push origin main               # Then push your changes

# Pull without opening editor (use with caution)
git pull --no-edit origin main
```

## Course 3: Introduction to GitHub Concepts (Beginner) ‚úÖ

### Chapter 01: What is GitHub?

#### Understanding GitHub
- **GitHub**: Cloud-based hosting service that allows users to store and track their work (version control)
- **On-demand resources**: Storage over the internet - no need to store large files locally
- **Similar platforms**: GitLab, BitBucket

#### GitHub Uses
- Storing projects
- Keeping track of projects and files
- Collaborating with others
- Social networking for developers
- Open-source project hosting

#### GitHub vs. Git
- **GitHub**: 
  - Enhances Git functionality
  - Makes project management and collaboration easier
  - Cannot be used without Git
- **Git**: 
  - Version control software
  - Can be used without GitHub or other hosting platforms
  - Core technology that GitHub builds upon

#### GitHub Repository (Repo)
- Contains all files of a project
- Records past versions of files
- Provides complete history of every project stage
- Enables collaboration where several people can work on the same file
- Can be accessed by anyone (for public repos)

#### Setting Up a Repository
**Creating a New Repository:**
- Navigate to GitHub website
- Click "New" or "Create repository"
- Choose repository name
- Select public or private
- Initialize with README (optional)
- Add .gitignore (optional)
- Choose license (optional)

**Repository Navigation:**
- Files tab: View all repository files
- Code tab: Browse source code
- Issues tab: Track bugs and feature requests
- Pull requests tab: Manage code contributions
- Actions tab: Automated workflows
- Settings tab: Repository configuration

#### Creating and Formatting README
**README Purpose:**
- Must be descriptive so anyone can understand the project
- Should list repository contents
- Clearly explains the project to others

**README Fundamentals:**
- **Title**: Clear project name
- **Description of technology**: What tools/languages are used
- **Why**: Purpose and motivation
- **Description of the process**: How it works
- **Table of contents**: For larger projects

**README Extras:**
- How the project came about
- The motivation behind it
- Limitations and challenges
- What problem it hopes to solve
- Intended use cases
- Credits and acknowledgments

**Markdown Formatting:**
```markdown
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3

**Bold text**
*Italic text*

[Link text](https://example.com)

![Image description](image-url)
```

**Edit vs. Preview:**
- Edit tab: Write markdown
- Preview tab: See formatted output

### Chapter 02: Repository Management and Collaboration

#### Modifying Repository Structure
**Creating New Files:**
- Click "Create new file" in repository
- Name the file with appropriate extension
- Add content in the editor
- Scroll down to commit section
- Add commit message
- Choose "Commit directly to main branch" or "Create new branch"

**Uploading Files:**
- Click "Upload files" in repository
- Drag and drop files or choose files
- Add commit message
- Commit changes

**Creating New Directories:**
- When creating a file, include directory name: `folder-name/file-name.ext`
- Directory is automatically created

**Modifying Files:**
- Click on file name to view
- Click pencil icon to edit
- Make changes
- Commit with descriptive message

**Deleting Files:**
- Navigate to file
- Click trash/delete icon
- Confirm deletion
- Commit changes

#### Working with Branches
**Purpose of Branches:**
- Enable concurrent work on different parts of a project
- Help reduce risk of conflicting file versions
- Allow experimentation without affecting main code

**Main Branch:**
- Default branch in repository
- Usually contains stable, production-ready code
- Protected from direct changes in professional settings

**Creating New Branches:**
- Click branch dropdown (usually shows "main")
- Type new branch name
- Click "Create branch" or press Enter
- New branch is created from current branch

**Branch Operations:**
```bash
# List all branches (shows current branch with *)
git branch

# Switch between branches
git switch branch-name
git switch main

# Create and switch to new branch
git switch -c new-branch-name
```

**Adding Files to Branches:**
- Switch to desired branch
- Add/modify files as normal
- Changes only affect current branch

**Comparing Branches:**
- Navigate to repository main page
- Click "Compare" or use branch dropdown
- Select branches to compare
- View differences between branches

#### Branch Protection Rules
**Purpose:**
- Set rules for specific branches
- Ensure code quality and review processes
- Prevent accidental changes to important branches

**Common Protection Rules:**
- **Require pull request before merging**: No direct commits to protected branch
- **Require pull request approval**: Changes must be reviewed and approved
- **Restrict who can delete**: Prevent accidental branch deletion

**Setting Up Protection Rules:**
1. Go to Settings > Branches
2. Click "Add rule" or "Add branch protection rule"
3. Specify branch name pattern
4. Select desired protection options
5. Save changes

#### Repository Access Control
**Why Restrict Access?**
- Datasets with personally identifiable information (PII)
- Commercial or proprietary products
- Sensitive business information
- Compliance requirements

**Private vs. Public Repositories:**
- **Public**: Anyone can view and fork
- **Private**: Only collaborators can access

**Creating Private Repository:**
- During repo creation, select "Private"
- For existing repo: Settings > General > Danger Zone > Change visibility

**Managing Collaborators:**
1. Go to Settings > Manage access
2. Click "Invite a collaborator"
3. Enter username, full name, or email
4. Send invitation
5. Collaborator receives email to accept

**Collaboration Permissions:**
- **Read**: View and download
- **Write**: Read + push changes
- **Admin**: Write + manage settings

#### Personal Access Tokens (PAT)
**Why PATs are Needed:**
- GitHub removed password authentication for Git operations (August 2021)
- More secure than passwords
- Required for terminal/command line access to repositories
- Not needed for GitHub web interface

**Authentication Error Example:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/user/repo
Username for 'https://github.com': username
Password for 'https://username@github.com': 
remote: Support for password authentication was removed on August 13, 2021.
```

**Creating a PAT:**
1. Go to GitHub Settings (profile menu)
2. Click "Developer settings" (bottom left)
3. Click "Personal access tokens" > "Tokens (classic)"
4. Click "Generate new token"
5. Add note describing token purpose
6. Set expiration date
7. Select scopes (permissions needed)
8. Click "Generate token"
9. **Copy token immediately** (won't be shown again)

**Using PAT:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/user/repo
Username for 'https://github.com': your-username
Password for 'https://your-username@github.com': [paste-PAT-here]
```

**PAT Security:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Never share your PAT**
- Treat it like a password
- Store securely (password manager recommended)
- Regenerate if compromised

### Chapter 03: Collaboration and Project Management

#### Using Other Repositories
**Cloning vs. Forking:**

**Cloning:**
- Similar to copy-paste but with a link to original repo
- Creates copy on local computer
- Linked to original repository
- Allows updates to go back and forth
- Use Git commands to push/pull changes
- Great for collaboration when you have access

**Forking:**
- Creates independent copy on GitHub
- No direct link to original repo
- Good for experimentation without risk
- Anyone can fork a public repo
- Submit changes via pull requests
- Different from creating branch (no collaborator access needed)

**Cloning Process:**
```bash
# Clone repository to local machine
git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git

# Example output
Cloning into 'repository-name'...
remote: Counting objects: 10, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (8/8), done.
remote: Total 10 (delta 1), reused 10 (delta 1)
Unpacking objects: 100% (10/10), done.
```

**Forking Process:**
1. Navigate to repository you want to fork
2. Click "Fork" button (top right)
3. Choose where to fork (your account or organization)
4. Wait for GitHub to create the fork
5. Fork appears in your repositories

#### GitHub Issues
**What are Issues?**
- Messages to help track:
  - Problem fixes
  - Plans and roadmaps
  - Important tasks
  - Communications about the project

**Creating New Issues:**
1. Go to repository's "Issues" tab
2. Click "New issue"
3. Add title and description
4. Use markdown for formatting
5. Submit issue

**Managing Issues:**
**Assigning Issues:**
- Assignee: Who should work on the issue
- Can assign to collaborators
- Multiple people can be assigned

**Tagging in Issues:**

- Create issue dependencies

**Closing Issues:**
- Click "Close issue" when resolved
- Add comment explaining resolution
- Closed issues remain accessible for reference

#### Pull Requests (PRs)
**What is a Pull Request?**
- Way to notify others about changes
- Allows repo owner to review changes before merging
- Best practice: create changes in separate branch (not main)
- Successful PR results in merging two branches

**Creating Pull Requests:**
1. Make changes in a branch (not main)
2. Navigate to repository
3. Click "Pull requests" tab
4. Click "New pull request"
5. Select branches to compare (base ‚Üê compare)
6. Review changes in diff view
7. Add title and description
8. Assign reviewers if needed
9. Create pull request

**Comparing Changes:**
- Shows differences between branches
- Green lines: additions
- Red lines: deletions
- File-by-file comparison
- Line-by-line changes highlighted

**PR Information:**
- Clear title describing changes
- Detailed description of what was changed
- Why changes were made
- Any testing performed
- Screenshots if UI changes

#### Reviewing Pull Requests
**Review Process Roles:**
- **Assignee**: Person who approves/merges the PR
- **Reviewer**: Person who examines changes before merge

**Requesting Reviews:**
1. In PR, click "Reviewers" section
2. Search for and select reviewers
3. Reviewers receive notification

**Conducting Reviews:**
1. Navigate to PR
2. Click "Files changed" tab
3. Review each changed file
4. Add comments on specific lines if needed

- Use markdown for formatting
- Reference other issues/PRs with #number

**Responding to Reviews:**
- Address requested changes
- Make additional commits to same branch
- Reply to comments explaining changes
- Request re-review after making changes

**Merging Pull Requests:**
1. Ensure all reviews are approved
2. All checks pass (if configured)
3. Click "Merge pull request"
4. Choose merge type:
   - **Create merge commit**: Preserves branch history
   - **Squash and merge**: Combines commits into one
   - **Rebase and merge**: Replays commits without merge commit
5. Confirm merge
